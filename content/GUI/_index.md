### GUI

# How to personalize the GUI

Before thinking about characters, backgrounds and music, we need to setup the look and feel of the game, that is, user interface. 
The user interface is just as important for the story, since it sets the mood for the player even before she starts playing it. There are many [resources](http://blog.cyanide-tea.net/2014/07/22/design-101-gui-design/) about how to choose the best interface for your game. There's also a rich community of visual novel developers who create and distribute their own art and designs, sometimes as free creative commons resources. 

RenJS allows you to set up a really simple user interface, that you can visually alter easily from the gui configuration file (GUI.yaml). It might be hard at first, especially if you're not a graphical designer, to figure out how to make changes to the GUI, but this system allows for a very flexible user interface that will enrich the story you want to tell.
