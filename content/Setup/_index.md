### Story Setup

# How to setup the story

The story setup is a way to declare every game object your story needs, and how it will look or sound. This basically means, we will be writing what image or resource is associated with each key name used in the story. The key names are what you use in the story script to call the game objects, so you don't have to reference the files directly in the story. If you later change the images, the story text will still be the same.
