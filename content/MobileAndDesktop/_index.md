### Mobile and Desktop

# Run your games everywhere

RenJS allows you to create HTML5 games, that is, games that run in a web browser. This means that any platform with a running web browser should be able to run your game. Linux, Mac, Windows and even mobile devices can do this, so by creating your game with RenJS, it's effectively multiplatform.

There's one catch, what if you don't want it online? Distributing the source code and executing an html file locally would work, but there's a better alternative. You can package your game as an executable for each platform, and your players would install it and play it in their favourite one like they do with other games.

In this section we will see a few different ways to achieve this. The RenJS Quickstart is already ported to three popular Frameworks for packaging:

* **Electron**: For Desktop applications only. Recommended for users with some computer knowledge.
* **Cordova**: For Mobile applications only. Recommended for users with some computer knowledge. Only exports to iOS from a Mac.
* **Cocoon**: Cloud platform for both desktop and mobile applications. Very easy to use, only upload the code, compile and download the results. Free version only allows two projects with a limit of 50mb.
