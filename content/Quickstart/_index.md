### Developer Guide

# Make your own game

If you're reading this, you're probably thinking about developing a Visual Novel. It doesn't matter if you've never made a game before, in this guide you'll find how to do it from scratch. You've probably heard about other game engines, like Unity or Game Maker. Those tools provide a whole environment for developing many kinds of games. 
RenJS is a bit different. First, RenJS is specially tailored to make games of the Visual Novel genre. You can use it for other kinds of games, but for that you'll need to extend the engine itself. But don't worry if don't know programming, cause you can still write VNs easily. 
The second difference is that RenJS refers only to the code that will be the core of your game. This means, unlike Unity or Game Maker, RenJS doesn't provide a development environment. There's no "program" you have to install or open to make your game. RenJS is just a bunch of files that know how to read a story and show it in a web browser. To write the story you only need a text processor, even something as simple as Gedit or Notepad. 

To start developing your game then you need a good text processor. My recomendation is [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). The second thing you need is [RenJS itself](https://gitlab.com/lunafromthemoon/RenJSTutorial).

In the next section, we'll see how to structure the files and directories of the game.
