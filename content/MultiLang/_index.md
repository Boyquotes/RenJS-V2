### Internationalization

# Multi Language Games

RenJS now provides a way to make your game multilanguage. For this you will need your story script translated to every language you want to provide. You'll also need an extra screen: Choosing the language. Due to the way the game is loaded, the player will have to choose the language at the start of the game, before the main menu is loaded. She cannot change the language in the middle of the game, but it's possible to do it by reloading the game. The save and load features will still work between languages, so it's of no concern for you what the player chooses and when.

So, let's check what we need to do for converting our Quickstart game into a multilanguage game.
